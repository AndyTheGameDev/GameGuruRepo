Experiment - Fuse Zombie AnimMove Melee

* Shows how many animations can be chained together inside the FPE to produce a final DBO file with built-in animations
* FPE is marked with 'isspinetracker = 1' which informs engine that this character can use 'animmove' movement
* Links to special AI script which uses 'animmove' system which reads animation shifts to calculate in-game movement
* Fuse model textures have been deliberately degraded and model converted to DBO to protect original Fuse assets
* Demonstrates the melee freeze feature which allows characters to hold the player while they attack
