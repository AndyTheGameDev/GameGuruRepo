How To Convert An OLD FPSC Character To GameGuru
------------------------------------------------

Old FPSC characters would not automatically work in GameGuru, and the process of converting them can be a little time consuming and varies based on when the old character was created and who created it (first or third party asset). Here are the steps I took to convert the ISSAC NEWTON character to become GameGuu friendly:

1. Edit the Isaac_Newton.fpe file and make the following changes
2. Delete the "aiinit" and "aidestroy" field lines, they are not used
3. Edit the "aimain" field data to "ai_neutral.lua"
4. Clean up the text file a little remove redundant line spaces between fields
5. Change the "fixnewy" to 0 (so facing the right way)
6. Change the "effect" field so it reads "effect = effectbank\reloaded\character_basic.fx"
7. Add the field "ragdoll = 1"
8. Add the field "skipfvfconvert = 1"
9. Renamed the texture from "Isaac_Newton_d2.tga" to "Isaac_Newton_d2.dds"
10. Change "decalmax" to zero and delete "decal0" and "decal1"
11. Delete the ";animationinfo" and all the anim lines (i.e. animmax, anim0, anim1 ... anim91).
12. Finally copy the ";anim" and ";AIAnims" groups from another character which uses the same legacy animations
13. Note About Step [12]: I used the animation data from the Bikini Girl from the Steam version (Files\entitybank\Classics\Characters)
14. Change the field named "offy" to "offsety" and change the value from 0 to 5 (which raises the characters feet from the floor)
15. If you then save this FPE file and start a fresh level and drop him in, and test game, he will idle and even mode if scripted
